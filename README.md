# Home-Loan-Data-Analysis-Project
Developed a deep learning model to predict the probability of loan defaults for a financial institution using historical lending data. The project focused on creating a safe lending experience by identifying whether future applicants would be able to repay their loans.

Key Responsibilities & Tech Stack:
Data Preprocessing: Handled data loading, identified null values, and performed categorical encoding for model compatibility.
Handling Imbalance: Analyzed the TARGET column to determine default percentages and implemented balancing techniques for the highly imbalanced dataset.
Deep Learning Model: Built a predictive model using Keras and TensorFlow within the finance domain.
Performance Metrics: Evaluated model effectiveness by calculating Sensitivity and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC).
Data Visualization: Created plots to visualize data distribution and the impact of balancing techniques.
Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
